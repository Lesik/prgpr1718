=== Overview ===
Did you ever want to have an application in which you can play Snake and simulate both Game of Life and Predator-Victim?
Us neither, but we had to write it anyway to pass the PRG-PR practical programming course at university. (We passed with 100%.)

=== How to compile and run ===
Create a makefile by issuing
  $ qmake prgpr1718.pro

A makefile has been created. Now run make:
  $ make

An executable has been compiled and linked. Run it:
  $ ./prgpr1718

Alternatively, open the project in QtCreator and use its built-in build tools.

=== Issues ===
There are no known issues. The program should work as expected.

=== Authors ===
This software has been written as a mandatory programming project for university by
- Kevin T.
- Javier Andres Q. A.
- Oles P.
